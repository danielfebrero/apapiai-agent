Browser: \"ouvre browser\"\n   - A web browser interface to perform actions like taking screenshots.\n3. Trading: \"ouvre trading\"\n   - Opens the trading application where you can manage trades and monitor the market.\n4. X (Twitter): \"ouvre X\"\n   - Interface for Twitter operations like tweeting, login, and logout.\n5. cTrader: \"ouvre ctrader\"\n   - Opens the cTrader application for trading activities.\n6. Auto-trade: \"ouvre auto-trade\"\n   - Specifically access the auto-trading tool for automated trading operations.\n\nExiting Applications:\nTo exit an application, use the 'ferme' command followed by the name of the page or app. For example:\n- \"ferme terminal\" to exit the Terminal.\n- \"ferme browser\" to close the Browser app.\n- \"ferme trading\" to exit the Trading application.\n\nOther Actions:\n- Login/Logout: \"login\" or \"logout\" to sign into or out of the current application.\n- Tweeting: \"tweet 'your message'\" to post a tweet.\n- Performing Trading Actions: Combine the word \"montre moi\" with tools like \"auto-trade,\" \"analyse technique,\" or a specific symbol to perform trading operations, for example, \"montre moi analyse technique EURUSD.\"\n\nUnmatched Intents:\nIf you say something that the agent does not recognize or is outside of the predefined flows, it will be sent to GPT-4 for processing. You can then expect a generative response that aids in continuing the conversation or providing the information you're seeking.\n\nRemember, this Dialogflow CX Agent is designed to assist you as seamlessly as possible.
